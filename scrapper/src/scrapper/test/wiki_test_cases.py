        The Estonian Centre Party, led by Jüri Ratas, formed a government after the 2019 parliamentary election, 
        with Ratas serving as prime minister. His government was brought down in January 2021 after a corruption investigation; 
        Kaja Kallas of the Estonian Reform Party formed a coalition government with the Centre Party afterward, 
        although it collapsed in June 2022. Kallas then formed a government with Isamaa and the Social Democratic Party and remained in the position of prime minister. 
        In January 2023, the National Electoral Committee announced that nine political parties and ten individual candidates had registered to take part in the 2023 parliamentary election.
